# ### The Regular Expressions

# Our expression will be of the form `_alert_this_ and _alert_that for _ng_repeat_expression_`. So,
# we just want a simple regular expression that matches groups for those three parts like so:
alertThisAndThatRegex = /^\s*([\s\S]+?)\s+and\s+([\s\S]+?)\s+for\s+([\s\S]+?)\s*$/

# #### Demystifying ngRepeat
# *FYI* The processing of ngRepeat's expression is just applying several regular expressions in phases.

# For instance, this is the regex for splitting the ngRepeat expression into its left and right sides. I.e. `ng-
# repeat="_left_side in _right_side_"`

# 	ngRepeatRegex = /^\s*([\s\S]+?)\s+in\s+([\s\S]+?)\s*$/

# This is the regex for extracting the various value pieces from the ngRepeat's left side. I.e.
# `_left_side` is `_value_|(_key_, _value_)`

# 	ngRepeatLhsRegex = /^(?:([\$\w]+)|\(([\$\w]+)\s*,\s*([\$\w]+)\))$/

# We need $compile to build our ngRepeat template with the ngRepeat expression extracted from the directive attribute. (We also get $log to log errors appropriately.)
angular.module( 'aModule', [ 'ng' ] ).directive( 'alertThisAndThat', ( $compile, $log )->

	# To prove we're not cheating, an isolate scope.
	scope: {}

	transclude: yes

	link: ( $scope, $element, $attrs ) ->

	# We need $attrs to process our expression, and we need $transclude to pass to the child directive that's going to use it from within its ngRepeat.
	controller: ( $scope, $attrs, $transclude ) ->
		expression = $attrs.alertThisAndThat
		return $log.warn "No expression for alertThisAndThat" unless expression?.length

		# Parse the overall expression:
		matches = expression.match alertThisAndThatRegex

		# And blow up if it didn't match:
		return $log.error "alertThisAndThat expression was malformed: #{ expression }" unless matches

		# Extract each sub-expression of it:
		thisExpression     = matches[ 1 ]
		thatExpression     = matches[ 2 ]
		ngRepeatExpression = matches[ 3 ]

		# And blow up if any of them weren't there:
		return $log.error "alertThisAndThat expression missing the this expression: #{     expression }" unless thisExpression?.length
		return $log.error "alertThisAndThat expression missing the that expression: #{     expression }" unless thatExpression?.length
		return $log.error "alertThisAndThat expression missing the ngRepeat expression: #{ expression }" unless ngRepeatExpression?.length

			$transclude       : $transclude
			thisExpression    : matches[ 1 ]
